    <h1>Luisa Jaime</h1>
    <p>Hi, my name is Luisa Jaime. I was born and raised in Guadalajara, Mexico.
    I moved to the US in 2019 for work. Even though San Diego is such a pretty city,
    I miss my country a lot. I hope that with this master's degree, I can change my career,
    and with that, be able to either get a remote job or hybrid position so I can visit my mom more often.</p>
